# SCWR-SP

This folder includes the full core models of a single pass SCWR (SCWR-SP) with the BOL fuel composition. The modeling is based upon the following works:

> Liu, Q., Oka, Y., 2015. Single pass core design for a Super Fast Reactor. Annals of Nuclear Energy 80, 451â€“459. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anucene.2015.02.036

> Oka, Y., Koshizuka, S., Ishiwatari, Y., Yamaji, A., 2010. Super Light Water Reactors and Super Fast Reactors. Springer US, Boston, MA. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-6035-1

The reference solutions were obtained via:
* OpenMC 0.13.3 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* Serpent 2.1.32 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* CSAS6 of SCALE 6.2.4 with the ENDF/B-VII.1-based SCALE 6.3 library
