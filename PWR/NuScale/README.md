# NuScale-like Core

This folder includes the full core models of a NuScale-like core with the BOL fuel composition. The modeling is completely based upon the public domain:

The reference solutions were obtained via:
* OpenMC 0.13.3 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* Serpent 2.1.32 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* CSAS6 of SCALE 6.2.4 with the ENDF/B-VII.1-based SCALE 6.3 library
