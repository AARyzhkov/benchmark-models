# ALFRED

This folder includes the full core models of ALFRED with the BOL fuel composition. The modeling is based upon the following work:

> Abrate N. Generalized perturbation techniques for uncertainty quantification in lead-cooled fast reactors / N. Abrate, S. Dulla, P. Ravetto // Annals of Nuclear Energy. – 2021. – Vol. 164. – P. 108623.

The reference solutions were obtained via:
* OpenMC 0.13.3 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* Serpent 2.1.32 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* CSAS6 of SCALE 6.2.4 with the ENDF/B-VII.1-based SCALE 6.3 library
