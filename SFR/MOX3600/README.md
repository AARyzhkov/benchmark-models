# MOX3600

This folder includes the full core models of MOX3600. The modeling is generally based upon the public domain and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency benchmark:

> NEA, 2015. Benchmark for Neutronic Analysis of Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor Cores with Various Fuel Types and Core Sizes (No. NEA/NSC/R(2015)9). OECD Publishing, Paris.

The reference solutions were obtained via:
* OpenMC 0.13.3 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* Serpent 2.1.32 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* CSAS6 of SCALE 6.2.4 with the ENDF/B-VII.1-based SCALE 6.3 library
