# CAR3600

This folder includes the full core models of CAR3600 with the BOEC fuel composition. The modeling is generally based upon the public domain and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency benchmark:

> NEA, 2015. Benchmark for Neutronic Analysis of Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor Cores with Various Fuel Types and Core Sizes (No. NEA/NSC/R(2015)9). OECD Publishing, Paris.

The reference solutions were obtained via:
* OpenMC 0.13.3 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* Serpent 2.1.32 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* CSAS6 of SCALE 6.2.4 with the ENDF/B-VII.1-based SCALE 6.3 library
