# MSFR (TRU+Th232)

This folder includes the full core models of MSFR (TRU+Th232) with the BOL fuel composition. The modeling is based upon the following work:

> Brovchenko, M., Kloosterman, J.-L., Luzzi, L., Merle, E., Heuer, D., Laureau, A., Feynberg, O., Ignatiev, V., Aufiero, M., Cammi, A., Fiorina, C., Alcaro, F., Dulla, S., Ravetto, P., Frima, L., Lathouwers, D., Merk, B., 2019. Neutronic benchmark of the molten salt fast reactor in the frame of the EVOL and MARS collaborative projects. EPJ Nuclear Sci. Technol. 5, 2. https://doi.org/10.1051/epjn/2018052

The reference solutions were obtained via:
* OpenMC 0.13.3 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* Serpent 2.1.32 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* CSAS6 of SCALE 6.2.4 with the ENDF/B-VII.1-based SCALE 6.3 library
