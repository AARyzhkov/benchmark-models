# MSFR (TRU+Th232)

This folder includes the full core models of MSFR-Cl (TRU+Th232) with the BOL fuel composition. The modeling is based upon the following work:

> Aghili Nasr, M., Zolfaghari, A., Akbari, R., Cammi, A., Amirkhosravi, S., 2023. Neutronic and fuel cycle performance analysis of fluoride and chloride fuels in Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). Nuclear Engineering and Design 413, 112506. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucengdes.2023.112506

The reference solutions were obtained via:
* OpenMC 0.13.3 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* Serpent 2.1.32 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* CSAS6 of SCALE 6.2.4 with the ENDF/B-VII.1-based SCALE 6.3 library
