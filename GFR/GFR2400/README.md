# GFR2400

This folder includes the full core models of GFR2400 with the BOL fuel composition. The modeling is based upon the following work:

> Perkó, Z., Pelloni, S., Mikityuk, K., Křepel, J., Szieberth, M., Gaëtan, G., Vrban, B., Lüley, J., Čerba, Š., Halász, M., Fehér, S., Reiss, T., Leen Kloosterman, J., Stainsby, R., Poette, C., 2015. Core neutronics characterization of the GFR2400 Gas Cooled Fast Reactor. Progress in Nuclear Energy 83, 460–481. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnucene.2014.09.016

The reference solutions were obtained via:
* OpenMC 0.13.3 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* Serpent 2.1.32 with ENDF/B-VII.1
* CSAS6 of SCALE 6.2.4 with the ENDF/B-VII.1-based SCALE 6.3 library
